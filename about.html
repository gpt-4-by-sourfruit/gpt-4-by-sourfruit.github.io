    <h1>About GPT-4</h1>
    
    <bannner>
      <pre class="about">
        
    GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. In OpenAI's case its Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3. 
I was denied by OpenAI to access GPT-3s API, I was excited for it! So after being denied twice, I set off on my own.

    This starts at the end of June; and at this point, I have had around 4-5 years of experience with devloping AI.  
I gather data from lots of places, with it being all in all around ~2TiBs. And GPT-3.1 has reached a somewhat good alpha 
by the end of July/start of August. By the end of August I have trained GPT-3.1 on roughly 1.6TiBs of data. 
 By the end of August/start of September GPT-3.1 has reached beta! Fun, right? Well no. Bug fixes were made in a span of 2
weeks of no-sleep. By mid-September GPT-3.1 looked more promising than ever. Up until this point, the goal was to copy OpenAI.
But...... if I have GPT-3.1 that is better than GPT-3 already, why not go further? 

    Since then GPT-3.1 has learned 3 more languages in additon to its 2. 5 languages to program in; 2 supported languages to write text in:
English and Russian. Then for programming languages: Python, HTMl, CSS, Ruby, Javascript.* 

   
<strong>Now, this is GPT-3.1 talk, but now its the 27th of October, 2020. Welcome GPT-4. GPT-3.1 but better, by up to 3x.</strong>

        + GPT-4 knows 4 more programming languages 
        + Can drive an RC car even better than before. (this was made a joke came reality)
        + 'Emotions' are in <strong>"alpha"</strong>. They're awful but its kind of hilarious when it can reply 'emotion'. 

        -- <strong>That's a short summary of what was changed. In reality a lot has changed, in almost every aspect.</strong>

        <strong>Coming soon...™️</strong>

        + *Better* Documentation
        + Generating faces (Just like <a class="docs" href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com">thispersondoesnotexist.com</a>)
        + Purchasing monthly/yearly plans via <a class="docs" href="https://gpt-4.co/pricing">the pricing page</a>.


GPT -4 is the most impressive AI-thing I've done yet. It's advancement for me, and quite frankly the new 'wave' of AI. and the closest 
thing I've seen to artifical general intelligence. It can program, it can penest, it can write, it can drive an RC car, it can be anything you want it to be. 

<strong>More information regarding GPT-4 will come-out soon. </strong>

Me / I refers to me, Sourfruit. The sole developer of GPT-3.1/GPT-4. Huge thanks to everyone that helped GPT-4 reach what it is now.
Wether it was an entire rack of servers with dual NVIDIA Tesla M10s, or just helped consult, thank you. You truly helped and I appreciate you.
